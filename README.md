Script created to draft multiple PDF copies of the Third German Protest Church Record Volume 08. The volume contains sensitive, copyright protected information that must be embargoed until certain dates. The entire volume (master PDF) is to be released in the year 2082, with partial versions released annually beginning in 2019.  

The Python script contains a dictionary where keys represent the year a PDF version is to be released, and its corresponding value is the number of pages (out of the master PDF) that that version contains. The script copies the pages and writes a new PDF.
